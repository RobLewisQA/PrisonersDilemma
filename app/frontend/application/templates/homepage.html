            <br>The Prisoners' Dilemma is a game used to understand how we should make decisions under specific circumstances.<br>
            
            <br>It is modelled on a 2 person/player interaction, where both players move at the same time and where each player only has 2 options - cooperate or defect <br>
            <br>
            <br><h4>The scoring works as follows:</h4>
            <br>   if both players cooperate, both score 4 points<br>
            <br>   if both players defect, both score 2 points<br>
            <br>   if one player cooperates while the other defects, the cooperator scores 0 points and the defector scores 8 points<br>
